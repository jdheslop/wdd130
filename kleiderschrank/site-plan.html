      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is for people who enjoy designing fashion as a fun game. First, a topic is selected - for example, "Lunch with the Queen". Then you will search through various images of shoes to find the pair of shoes that they would wear to that event. </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intitial intended audience is mostly teenager girls and women who are interested in fashion and enjoy creating fashion ideas to fit a purpose.</p>
