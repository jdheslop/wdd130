    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The website is to share information about an opportunity to experience nature with friends in unique way.  My purpose is to develop a website which enables me to learn, practice, and try new concepts in html and css - and hopefully create a website that looks good at the same time. :) </p>
    
    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The audience is people of all ages who enjoy spending times with friends in nature and are looking for an exciting opportunity to do that in a non-typical way. The assumption is that the audience has little or no experience with whitewater rafting. Since it will be for all ages and interests there will be information about high-action routes, but also calm routes. The main focus in each of the routes will be to enjoy the scenery. The audience will primary access the site from a desktop or laptop, but will also need the possibility to access it from a mobile device.</p>
