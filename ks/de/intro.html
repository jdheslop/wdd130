                <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
                    <p>A few years ago, while on vacation with my family in the Normandy region of France, my wife and two daughters created a game. They would think of a fashion theme and would search various fashion websites to find the perfect outfit to match that theme. They would make screenshots of the clothing that they liked best and, when they were finished, they would compare the groups of screenshots that they had made. As a dad, I was glad that they found something that they had fun doing, but I thought that there had to be a better way to do it.</p>
                    <p>As a hobby, I recently took a couple of programming classes and this is the result. I hope that you can also enjoy the experience, but this is mostly just something that a dad made for his wife and daughters.</p>
